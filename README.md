turbospaces
===========

Features:

* Re-newal of JavaSpace technology based on disruptor/off-heap/spring API/guava/kryo libraries with user-friendly API and simple configuration
* OffHeap memory solution not bound and is not restricted by the java heap space similar to SUN's DirectBuffer
with minimal GC impact(0.2-0.5% of JVM time) capable to handle millions transactions per second on standard (pretty
cheap) environment running on any platform - pure java code without JNA or JNI.
* Guava's Cache off-heap interface implementation
* Spring's 3.1 Cache off-heap interface implementation
* In-memory object oriented transactional database with advanced access patterns(exclusive reads,locks with timeouts, etc)
* User-controlled data partitioning and native integration with databases with dynamic failover(without typical backup replications between nodes in cluster)
* Elastic external data source bindings - JPA/MongoDB/JDBC/Redis or any other storage support by spring-data.
* Distributed and persistent implementation of JavaSpace API.
* Powerful event-driven remoting via synchronous remote method invocation(don't confuse with RMI) or either
asynchronous via write/notify message delivery model.
* Support for message driven exchange pattern (integration with JMS API).
* Unlimited and linear scalability.
* Powerful web-based monitoring system and alerting engine(also can be exposed through JMX).
* Distributed Lock/Executor Service.
* Multicast and unicast discovery.
* Tight integration with spring framework (namespace, transaction management, lifecycle, events, caching layer).
* Super small: near 250 KB
* Customizable for concrete scenarios in terms of serialization, network communications, database integrations

###performance testing
turbospaces achieves 2-3M in-memory transaction on typical hardware on a single JVM node with GC impact about 0.2% of total time
